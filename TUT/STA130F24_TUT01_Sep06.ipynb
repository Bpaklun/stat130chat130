Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "> In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.  Indeed, this is exactly the behavior [hardcoded into copilot](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/is-this-even-normal/0b6dcab3-7d6c-4373-8efe-d74158af3c00)... the thing is, you'll like it better if you do it to copilog before copilot does it to you ;)\n",

    "    > To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatChat, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "    > - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "    > \n",
    "    > > Remember, ChatGPT will allow you to upload your data, but for this class we don't want ChatGPT to just do the analysis for us. **DO NOT purchase an upgrade of ChatGPT**. We instead want ChatBots to help us understand the steps we need to take to analyze the data. \n",
    "    > > - [Copilot Pro](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) which you have access to through your UofT account is anyway based on [ChatGPT4.0](https://chat.openai.com/)...   \n",

    "    1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from your data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "        > If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "        > - Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors \n",
    "        > First share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT\n",

    "            >  - When python has an error, it sometimes provides a lot of \"stack trace\" output, but that's not usually very important for troubleshooting. For this problem for example, all you need to share with ChatGPT or search on google is `\"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\"`\n",

    "        2. Mistype \"titanic.csv\" as \"titanics.csv\" \n",

    "            2. Explore introducing typos into a couple other parts of the url and note the slightly different errors this produces\n",

    "        7. Forget to put the column name as a string in quotes for the `groupby` and column selection, and see if the ChatBot and google are still as helpful as they were for the previous question\n",
