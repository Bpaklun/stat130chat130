# Survivorship Bias Explained

#### You:
What's survivorship bias?

#### ChatGPT:
Survivorship bias refers to the error that can occur when analyzing data or drawing conclusions from a sample that only includes surviving or successful elements, while ignoring those that did not survive or were not successful. This bias can lead to misleading conclusions because the sample does not accurately represent the entire population.

For example, if you only study successful businesses to determine the key factors for success, you might overlook important variables that contributed to the failure of other businesses. Similarly, studying only the survivors of a war might not provide an accurate understanding of the true risks and challenges faced by soldiers.

In essence, survivorship bias distorts our perception of reality by focusing only on the outcomes that were achieved, while neglecting the full spectrum of possibilities and outcomes.


#### You:
This is a little confusing...

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, let's break it down with a simpler example:

Imagine you're trying to figure out the secret to becoming a successful YouTuber. You decide to study the top 100 YouTubers and analyze what they have in common. You find that they all upload videos consistently, engage with their audience, and have catchy thumbnails.

However, what you're missing is the full picture. You've only looked at the successful YouTubers who made it to the top 100. You haven't considered the thousands of other YouTubers who also uploaded consistently, engaged with their audience, and had catchy thumbnails but didn't achieve the same level of success. Maybe they quit due to burnout, never gained traction, or faced other challenges.

This oversight is survivorship bias. By focusing only on the successful YouTubers, you're missing out on important information about why others didn't succeed. It's like trying to understand the entire forest by only looking at the tallest trees.


#### You:
I think maybe the class mentioned some examples about songs on Spotify or planes in world war 2 or something like that?

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, those are classic examples of survivorship bias:

1. **Songs on Spotify**: If you analyze the most popular songs on Spotify, you might notice that they have certain characteristics in common, such as catchy melodies or relatable lyrics. However, what you might not see are the thousands of songs that were released but never gained traction, despite having similar qualities. By only looking at the successful songs, you're missing the broader context of the music industry and what factors contribute to success or failure.

2. **Planes in World War II**: During World War II, aircraft that returned from missions were often examined for damage to determine where they were most vulnerable to enemy fire. Initially, the focus was on reinforcing areas where returning planes showed the most damage. However, statistician Abraham Wald pointed out that this approach suffered from survivorship bias. The planes that made it back safely were the ones that could sustain damage in certain areas and still fly. The areas that needed reinforcement were those where the returning planes showed no damage, suggesting that planes hit there were less likely to return. This led to a shift in strategy, focusing on reinforcing the areas with no visible damage, as those were likely critical for survival.

In both cases, survivorship bias occurs when we focus only on the survivors (successful songs or returning planes) and overlook the failures (unsuccessful songs or planes that didn't return). This limited perspective can lead to flawed conclusions and decision-making.


#### You:
Do you suppose I'm biased by survivorship bias?

#### ChatGPT:
It's possible! Survivorship bias can affect anyone, as it's a common cognitive bias that arises from our tendency to focus on visible, surviving examples while overlooking less visible or absent ones.

Reflect on situations where you've drawn conclusions based only on successful outcomes or examples. Ask yourself if you've considered the full range of possibilities, including failures or non-successes, when making decisions or forming opinions. Being aware of survivorship bias is the first step in mitigating its effects.

If you're uncertain whether survivorship bias is influencing your thinking in a particular situation, try to gather data or perspectives from a broader range of sources, including both successes and failures. This can help provide a more balanced and accurate view of the topic at hand.


#### You:
How do you think survivorship bias might affect me?

#### ChatGPT:
Survivorship bias could influence your decision-making and perceptions in various ways, depending on the context of your experiences and the areas of your life where you encounter it. Here are a few potential examples:

1. **Career or Success**: If you only focus on successful individuals in your field or those who have achieved certain milestones, you might overlook the challenges, setbacks, or alternative paths taken by others. This could lead to unrealistic expectations or strategies based solely on the experiences of a select few.

2. **Investments or Entrepreneurship**: When studying successful businesses or investments, you might be drawn to strategies or practices that worked for those who prospered, without considering the failures or market conditions that contributed to their success. This could lead to overly optimistic risk assessments or failure to anticipate potential pitfalls.

3. **Personal Development**: In areas like self-improvement or skill-building, you might be influenced by success stories or role models who have achieved remarkable results. However, this could create pressure to achieve similar outcomes without acknowledging the individual circumstances, resources, or luck involved in those success stories.

4. **Social Comparison**: On social media or in social circles, you might compare yourself to others who appear successful or happy based on their visible achievements or lifestyles. This could lead to feelings of inadequacy or pressure to measure up to unrealistic standards, without considering the full range of experiences and challenges faced by others.

Awareness of survivorship bias can help you approach these situations with a more critical mindset, seeking out diverse perspectives and considering the full spectrum of outcomes, not just the ones that are most visible or celebrated.

I'm not sure that I'll have time to do that...

#### ChatGPT:
That's completely understandable! If you're short on time, you can still gain a basic understanding of survivorship bias and other cognitive biases through simpler explanations and examples. Here's a quick summary to help:

Survivorship bias is a common cognitive bias where we focus on the successes or surviving examples while ignoring the failures or non-surviving examples. This can lead to distorted perceptions and flawed decision-making because we're not considering the full range of possibilities.

For instance, if you only study successful people in a particular field to understand what leads to success, you might miss important factors that contributed to their success, as well as factors that led to failure for others.

In essence, survivorship bias reminds us to look beyond the visible successes and consider the entire spectrum of outcomes when analyzing data or drawing conclusions.

If you ever find yourself in situations where you're making decisions based solely on successful examples or ignoring failures, it's helpful to pause and consider whether survivorship bias might be at play. By being aware of this bias, you can strive for more balanced and informed decision-making.
