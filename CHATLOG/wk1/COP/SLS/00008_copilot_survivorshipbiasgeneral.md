What's survivorship bias?

CP:
Survivorship bias, also known as survival bias, is a logical error that occurs when the focus is solely on the entities or individuals that have passed a certain selection process, while those that did not pass are overlooked¹. This can lead to incorrect conclusions due to incomplete data¹.

For example, in the field of finance, if an analysis of financial performance only includes companies that are currently in operation and excludes those that have gone bankrupt, it could lead to overly optimistic beliefs¹. This is because the analysis would overlook the multiple failures, leading to the false belief that the successes in the group have some special property¹.

Another example of survivorship bias is in research studies. If a hospital is conducting research on trauma patients admitted to the ER, but the study only includes patients who were stable enough to give consent, it could lead to survivorship bias². This is because the study excludes everyone who didn’t survive their injuries or is too sick to consent, which may lead to incorrect conclusions².

In essence, survivorship bias can lead to skewed results and inaccurate conclusions because it fails to consider all relevant data¹². It's important to be aware of this bias in order to make more informed and accurate decisions or conclusions.

Survivorship bias is a logical error that occurs when conclusions are drawn from a subset of data that has "survived" some selection process, while ignoring the data that did not make it through the same process. This can lead to incorrect or misleading results because the non-surviving entities are not taken into account, which might skew the analysis.

For example, if you were to analyze the success of companies in a certain industry by only looking at the ones that are currently thriving, without considering the many that may have failed and ceased to exist, you would likely overestimate the overall success rate and miss out on understanding the full range of factors that contribute to success or failure.

A classic illustration of survivorship bias is from World War II research on bomber planes. Engineers initially examined the planes that returned from missions and suggested reinforcing the areas with the most bullet holes. However, a statistician pointed out that they should instead reinforce the areas where the bullet holes weren't present, as planes hit in those areas didn't return and were missing from the analysis².

This type of bias can affect various fields, including finance, research, and business, leading to overly optimistic beliefs or flawed decision-making because it only accounts for the "survivors," while the failures are overlooked¹²³⁴. To avoid survivorship bias, it's important to consider all relevant data, both surviving and non-surviving, to get a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the situation.
