Jun 1 2024: another failure at finding data

S:
I have a challenge for you. Usually "bots like you" perform poorly on this task, but I want you to do a good job for me to prove my historical experiences wrong. I'm looking for a working url link to a csv file of an funny or amusing data set that has missing values that I can used to demonstrate using pandas and handling missing values. Can you suggest a data set for me that fits this criteria for me?

C:
I found a few amusing datasets that you might find interesting:

1. **Central Park Squirrel Census**: This dataset is about the squirrels in New York's Central Park¬π. It's quite delightful and could have missing values for you to handle.

2. **California License Plate Reviews**: This dataset contains reviews of license plates¬π. The content is funny and the commentary takes it over the top.

3. **Public Toilets in Australia**: This dataset contains the details of every public toilet in Australia¬π. It's an unusual dataset that could be fun to work with.

4. **Bad Words Dataset**: This dataset contains a list of bad words¬π. It's a bit edgy, but could be amusing depending on your sense of humor.

Please note that I can't guarantee these datasets will have missing values as it's not explicitly mentioned. However, real-world datasets often do have missing values, so there's a good chance you'll find some in these datasets. You can use pandas functions like `isnull()` or `notnull()` to identify missing values in the dataset. If you need more help with handling missing values in pandas, feel free to ask! Enjoy your data exploration! üòä

S:
Uh oh... this is not going well (as usual)... let me try that again, and this time really try to emphasize (since explicitly stating that as my first criterion seems to not be enough...) that I'm looking for a url to a csv file: "I'm looking for a working url link to a csv file of an funny or amusing data set that has missing values that I can used to demonstrate using pandas and handling missing values. Can you suggest a data set for me that fits this criteria for me?"

C:
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here are a couple of amusing datasets in CSV format that you might find interesting:

1. **Energy Level.csv**: This is a simulated dataset that was created to be used in an independent t-test and compared two groups, Group A and Group B, on some outcome measure¬π. You can find this dataset on GitHub¬π.

2. **Diabetes Missing Data.csv**: This dataset is available on GitHub¬≤. It's a diabetes dataset, which might not be inherently funny, but you could certainly make it amusing depending on how you present it!

Please note that while these datasets are in CSV format and are likely to have missing values, I can't guarantee that they will as it's not explicitly mentioned. However, real-world datasets often do have missing values, so there's a good chance you'll find some in these datasets. You can use pandas functions like `isnull()` or `notnull()` to identify missing values in the dataset. If you need more help with handling missing values in pandas, feel free to ask!

S:
Umm... "diabetes... you could certainly make it amusing depending on how you present it"... that's a pretty wild suggestion... what exactly do you have in mind here that makes diabetes amusing?

C:
We seem to be off track again... let me this time emphasize the next (lol) criterion I requested... "a funny or amusing data set": "I'm looking for a working url link to a csv file of an funny or amusing data set that has missing values that I can used to demonstrate using pandas and handling missing values. Can you suggest a data set for me that fits this criteria for me?"

S:
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here are a couple of amusing datasets in CSV format that you might find interesting:

1. **Reddit Clean Jokes Dataset**: This dataset contains clean jokes from Reddit¬π‚Å¥. It's a light-hearted and fun dataset that you might enjoy exploring.

2. **r/Jokes Dataset**: This is a large scale humor dataset, containing more than 550k rated English jokes‚Åµ. While the dataset is not in CSV format, you could potentially convert it to CSV for your analysis.

3. **UR-FUNNY Dataset**: This is the first dataset for multimodal humor detection¬≥. It's an interesting dataset that explores the concept of humor.

Please note that while these datasets are in CSV format and are likely to have missing values, I can't guarantee that they will as it's not explicitly mentioned. However, real-world datasets often do have missing values, so there's a good chance you'll find some in these datasets.
