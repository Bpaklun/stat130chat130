S:
can you explain survivorship bias using popular Spotify songs as an example?

C:
Certainly! Survivorship bias is a logical error that occurs when we focus only on the successful examples while ignoring those that did not make it. This can lead to a skewed perception of reality and incorrect conclusions because the failures are not taken into account¹.

Let's use popular Spotify songs as an example to illustrate survivorship bias. Imagine you're looking at a playlist of the most streamed songs on Spotify⁵. These songs are the 'survivors'; they've made it to the top and are receiving a lot of attention and plays. It's easy to think that these songs represent the typical success one can expect from releasing music on Spotify.

However, this perspective ignores the vast majority of songs that never make it to such playlists. For every hit song on Spotify, there are countless others that receive very little attention. These 'non-survivors' are crucial to understanding the full picture. If you were to assess the likelihood of success for a new song based only on the top hits, you'd be falling prey to survivorship bias. You're not considering the many songs that didn't 'survive' the competition to become a hit.

In reality, the chance of a song becoming a hit is much lower than the top playlists might suggest. To avoid survivorship bias, it's important to look at the entire spectrum of songs, including those that aren't popular or have been forgotten, to get a more accurate understanding of what success in the music industry looks like. This helps in setting realistic expectations and making informed decisions based on a complete set of data, not just the most visible successes.
