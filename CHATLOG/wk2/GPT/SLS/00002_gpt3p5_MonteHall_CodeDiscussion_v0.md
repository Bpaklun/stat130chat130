This Monte Hall simulation code aims to replicate the Monty Hall problem multiple times and calculate the probability of winning if you always switch your choice after a losing door is revealed. Let's break down what the code does step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple
   my_door_choice = 1  # 1, 2, 3
   i_won = 0
   reps = 100000
   ```
   - `all_door_options` is a tuple representing the three doors.
   - `my_door_choice` is the initial door choice (always starting with door 1).
   - `i_won` is a counter for the number of wins.
   - `reps` is the number of repetitions for the simulation.

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(reps):
   ```
   - The loop runs `reps` times to simulate multiple rounds of the Monty Hall game.

3. **Selecting the Winning Door**:
   ```python
   secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
   ```
   - `secret_winning_door` is randomly selected as one of the three doors.

4. **Creating a List of Doors to Reveal**:
   ```python
   all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)
   all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)
   ```
   - Convert the tuple to a list and remove the `secret_winning_door` from the list to avoid revealing it as a goat door.

5. **Removing the Initial Choice if It's Not the Winning Door**:
   ```python
   try:
       all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)
   except:
       pass
   ```
   - Attempt to remove `my_door_choice` from the list of doors (if it's not the winning door, it's removed; if it is, it was already removed).

6. **Revealing a Goat Door**:
   ```python
   goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)
   all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)
   ```
   - Randomly select a goat door to reveal from the remaining doors and remove it from the list.

7. **Restoring the Winning Door (if necessary)**:
   ```python
   if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:
       all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)
   ```
   - If the initial choice was not the winning door, add the winning door back to the list of remaining doors.

8. **Switching the Choice**:
   ```python
   my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]
   ```
   - Switch the choice to the remaining door (which could be either the winning door or a goat door).

9. **Checking if the New Choice is a Win**:
   ```python
   if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:
       i_won += 1
   ```

10. **Calculating and Printing the Win Rate**:
    ```python
    i_won/reps
    ```
    - The win rate is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the total number of repetitions.

The logic behind the Monty Hall problem is that switching doors gives a higher probability of winning (2/3) compared to sticking with the original choice (1/3). This code effectively demonstrates that by simulating many rounds and showing that the win rate converges to approximately 2/3 when always switching doors.
