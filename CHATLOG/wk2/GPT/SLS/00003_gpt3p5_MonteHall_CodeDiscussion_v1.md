# Monte Hall Simulation Code -- not the only way to code this, but it's what Prof. Schwartz came up with...

import numpy as np
all_door_options = (1,2,3)  # tuple
my_door_choice = 1  # 1,2,3
i_won = 0
reps = 100000
for i in range(reps):
    secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
    all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)
    # take the secret_winning_door, so we don't show it as a "goat" losing door
    all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)
    try:
        # if my_door_choice was secret_winning_door then it's already removed
        all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)
    except:
        pass
    # show a "goat" losing door and remove it
    goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)
    all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)

    # put the secret_winning_door back in if it wasn't our choice
    # we previously removed it, so it would be shown as a  "goat" losing door
    if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:
        all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)
    # if secret_winning_door was our choice then all that's left in the list is a "goat" losing door
    # if secret_winning_door wasn't our choice then it's all that will be left in the list

    # swap strategy
    my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]

    if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:
        i_won += 1

#### ChatGPT:
Great, let's break down this Monte Hall simulation code step-by-step to understand what it's doing.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initial Setup**:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple
   my_door_choice = 1  # 1, 2, 3
   i_won = 0
   reps = 100000
   ```

   - `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library for random number generation.
   - `all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)`: Defines the three doors.
   - `my_door_choice = 1`: Initially, you always choose door 1.
   - `i_won = 0`: Counter for the number of wins.
   - `reps = 100000`: Number of simulation repetitions.

2. **Simulation Loop**:

   ```python
   for i in range(reps):
       secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
       all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)
       all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)
       try:
           all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)
       except:
           pass
       goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)
       all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)
       if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:
           all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)
       my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]
       if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:
           i_won += 1
   ```

   - **For Loop**: Runs the simulation `reps` times.
   - `secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)`: Randomly selects the winning door.
   - `all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)`: Converts the tuple of doors into a list for manipulation.
   - `all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)`: Removes the winning door from the list.
   - `try ... except ... pass`: Attempts to remove your initial choice from the list (if it's not the winning door, hence the `try...except` block).
   - `goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)`: Randomly selects one of the remaining doors (which must be a losing door, since the winning door was removed).
   - `all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)`: Removes the revealed losing door.
   - `if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice: all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)`: If the initial choice was not the winning door, add the winning door back to the list.
   - `my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]`: Switch to the remaining door.
   - `if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door: i_won += 1`: Increment the win counter if the new choice is the winning door.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   ```python
   i_won / reps
   ```
   - This line calculates the win rate by dividing the number of wins by the number of repetitions.

### What the Code is Doing

- **Initial Choice**: You always start by choosing door 1.
- **Winning Door**: A random door is selected as the winning door.
- **Goat Door Reveal**: A door that is not the winning door and not your initial choice is revealed (showing a goat).
- **Switch**: You switch your choice to the remaining door.
- **Win Check**: The code checks if your new choice (after switching) is the winning door and counts it as a win if it is.
- **Repetition**: This process is repeated `reps` times to simulate the game multiple times and calculate the win rate.

### Monte Hall Problem Insight

The Monte Hall problem demonstrates that switching doors increases your probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. This code simulates that strategy and should result in a win rate close to 2/3 when run.

#### You:
Can you break it down a little more slowly, piece by piece?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, let's break down the code piece by piece, explaining each part in detail.

### Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
```

- **`import numpy as np`**: Imports the NumPy library, which is used for generating random numbers and performing other numerical operations.

### Initial Setup

```python
all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple
my_door_choice = 1  # 1,2,3
i_won = 0
reps = 100000
```

- **`all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)`**: Defines the three possible doors as a tuple.
- **`my_door_choice = 1`**: Initially, you always choose door number 1.
- **`i_won = 0`**: Initializes a counter to track the number of times you win.
- **`reps = 100000`**: Sets the number of simulation repetitions to 100,000.

### Simulation Loop

This loop will repeat the process 100,000 times:

```python
for i in range(reps):
```

- **`for i in range(reps)`**: Starts a loop that will run `reps` times (100,000 times in this case).

#### Selecting the Winning Door

```python
    secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
```

- **`secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)`**: Randomly selects one of the doors to be the winning door.

#### Preparing Door Options

```python
    all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)
    all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)
```

- **`all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)`**: Converts the tuple of doors into a list to allow modification.
- **`all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)`**: Removes the winning door from the list. This leaves only the non-winning doors in the list.

#### Removing the Initial Choice

```python
    try:
        all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)
    except:
        pass
```

- **`try ... except ... pass`**: Attempts to remove your initial door choice from the list. If your initial choice was the winning door, it was already removed, and the `except` block will handle the `ValueError` by doing nothing (`pass`).

#### Revealing a Goat Door

```python
    goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)
    all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)
```

- **`goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)`**: Randomly selects one of the remaining doors (which must be a losing door since the winning door was removed) to be the revealed goat door.
- **`all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)`**: Removes the revealed goat door from the list.

#### Handling the Remaining Doors

```python
    if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:
        all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)
```

- **`if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:`**: Checks if the initial choice was not the winning door.
- **`all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)`**: If the initial choice was not the winning door, adds the winning door back to the list. This ensures the list now contains only one door, which is either the remaining goat door or the winning door.

#### Switching the Choice

```python
    my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]
```

- **`my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]`**: Switches your choice to the remaining door in the list (after removing the revealed goat door and possibly adding back the winning door).

#### Checking the Win Condition

```python
    if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:
        i_won += 1
```

- **`if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:`**: Checks if your new choice (after switching) is the winning door.
- **`i_won += 1`**: Increments the win counter if you chose the winning door.

### Result Calculation

```python
i_won / reps
```

- **`i_won / reps`**: Calculates the win rate by dividing the number of wins by the number of repetitions. This gives the probability of winning when you switch doors.

### Summary

- **Initial Choice**: You always start by choosing door 1.
- **Winning Door**: A random door is selected as the winning door.
- **Goat Door Reveal**: One of the non-winning, non-chosen doors is revealed to be a goat.
- **Switch**: You switch your choice to the remaining door.
- **Win Check**: If the switched door is the winning door, you count it as a win.
- **Repetition**: This process is repeated 100,000 times to simulate the game multiple times and calculate the win rate.

This simulation demonstrates that by switching doors, you increase your chances of winning from 1/3 (if you stick with your initial choice) to 2/3.


#### You:
okay, I understand. Is there a simpler way to code up this simulation? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there is a simpler way to code the Monty Hall simulation that avoids some of the list manipulations and condition checks. Here is a more streamlined version of the simulation:

### Simplified Monte Hall Simulation Code

```python
import numpy as np

all_door_options = [1, 2, 3]
reps = 100000
i_won = 0

for _ in range(reps):
    winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
    initial_choice = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
    
    # The host reveals a door that is neither the winning door nor the initial choice
    remaining_doors = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != winning_door]
    revealed_door = np.random.choice(remaining_doors)
    
    # Switch to the other remaining door
    switch_choice = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != revealed_door][0]
    
    if switch_choice == winning_door:
        i_won += 1

win_rate = i_won / reps
print(win_rate)
```

### Explanation of the Simplified Code

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   all_door_options = [1, 2, 3]
   reps = 100000
   i_won = 0
   ```
   - `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library for random number generation.
   - `all_door_options = [1, 2, 3]`: Defines the three doors as a list.
   - `reps = 100000`: Number of simulation repetitions.
   - `i_won = 0`: Counter for the number of wins.

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(reps):
       winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
       initial_choice = np.random.choice(all_door_options)
   ```
   - `for _ in range(reps)`: Starts the loop to run the simulation `reps` times.
   - `winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)`: Randomly selects the winning door.
   - `initial_choice = np.random.choice(all_door_options)`: Randomly selects the initial choice (this is to demonstrate that the code can start with any door, not just door 1).

3. **Reveal a Goat Door**:
   ```python
       remaining_doors = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != winning_door]
       revealed_door = np.random.choice(remaining_doors)
   ```
   - `remaining_doors = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != winning_door]`: Constructs a list of doors that are neither the initial choice nor the winning door.
   - `revealed_door = np.random.choice(remaining_doors)`: Randomly selects a door to reveal, which is always a goat.

4. **Switch Choice**:
   ```python
       switch_choice = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != revealed_door][0]
   ```
   - `switch_choice = [door for door in all_door_options if door != initial_choice and door != revealed_door][0]`: Switches to the door that is not the initial choice and not the revealed door.

5. **Check for Win**:
   ```python
       if switch_choice == winning_door:
           i_won += 1
   ```
   - `if switch_choice == winning_door`: Checks if the switched door is the winning door.
   - `i_won += 1`: Increments the win counter if the switch choice is the winning door.

6. **Result Calculation**:
   ```python
   win_rate = i_won / reps
   print(win_rate)
   ```
   - `win_rate = i_won / reps`: Calculates the win rate by dividing the number of wins by the number of repetitions.
   - `print(win_rate)`: Prints the win rate, which should be close to 2/3.

### Summary

This simplified code still performs the same simulation as the original, but with fewer steps and clearer logic. It directly simulates the process of choosing, revealing, and switching, making it easier to understand and maintain.
